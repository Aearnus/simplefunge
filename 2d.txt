← = move cursor left until a direction change command is encountered
→ = move cursor right until a direction change command is encountered
↑ = move cursor up until a direction change command is encountered
↓ = move cursor down until a direction change command is encountered
↔ = move cursor right if top of stack is >0 or left otherwise

í = input character
i = input integer
ó = output character
o = output integer
0-9 = push number to top of stack
+ = add numbers on top of stack
- = subtract numbers on top of stack, going backwards, as in "top - second to top"
* = multiply numbers on top of stack
/ = divide numbers on top of stack, going backwards, as in "top / second to top"
^ = exponent numbers on top of stack, going backwards, as in "second to top ^ top"
` =  pop top of stack
! = duplicate top of stack (OH GOD THERE ARE TWO OF THEM)
 (space) = continue direction of cursor
@ = end of program
note: characters get converted to integers on the stack
